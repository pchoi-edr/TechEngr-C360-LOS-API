# SRF Custom Fields

C360 understands that our clients have unique requirements where it is not all together appropriate to map to existing fields or for C360 to provide a specific field all the time.

If the custom fields were just random field names, that task would be easy. However, these custom fields must properly map with form fields in C360.

In C360, EDR supports very complex forms with parent child relationships, nested form components, complex and custom validation rules. Therefore, the schema format EDR has adopted is [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/). EDR C360 supports 100% of JSON Schema. We also support an extended schema, which is documented here.
